## Address Book

Initial project creation.

### Goals:

1. To create a functional address book application that allows 
the addition, removal, storage, editing, importing and exporting of address
information. It should be cross platform working in Windows 8+, Linux 
(Mainline distros), Mac, Android, and iOS. IF possible.
2. Demonstrate good programming practices and improve my personal coding
understanding and abilities.
